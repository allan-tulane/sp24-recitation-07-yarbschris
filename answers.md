- **2)** The work is O(2m) + O(n) + O(1)

- **4)** Reachable is called once in all cases, but it's worst case would be when the graph is fully connected ig

- **5)** The work is O(2m) + O(n) + O(1)

- **7)** Switching from the graph representation to an adjacency matrix changes the reachable function's complexity from $O(n + m)$ to $O(n^2)$ since you need to check the connections for each node
